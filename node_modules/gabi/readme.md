5. ðŸ§ª Test locally
   There is a way to test our package locally, before uploading it to npm.

Create a new folder on your computer and install Svelte.

From the terminal, in your package's directory, run the command npm link
From the newly created folder where we installed Svelte in step 1, open a new terminal located in that directory and run the command npm link /path/of/your-package.
This will allow us to test the package locally, and also if we make any modifications to it, there is no need to update or install each time, it updates itself.
